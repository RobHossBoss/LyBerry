The lights in the shittle flashed yellow to indicate atmosphere entry. \r\n\r\n“I have taken lives, but I am not a murderer.”\r\n\r\nA neighboring passenger who sat to his right cleared his throat loudly. \r\n\r\n“I dont work for anyone, not a soldier or an assassian.”\r\n\r\nDarrus loked out the suttle’s bay window and saw a black mist sourounding the city.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps I should be an assassian, there are many overloards willing to hire. It would pay very well.”\r\n\r\nThe being who sat adjacent to DArrus was a young female Karian with beautiful blue skin. DArrus remembered reading of the first encounter with Karians and humans. As the historical text read, “The Karians gave us technology we gave them philosophy.” \r\n\r\nShe wore ceremonial Karian roves which suggested governemnt status and wealth. She was a senator. \r\n\r\nThe lights tured blue and the shuttle doors opened and the black fog began to enter the doors and fill the shuttle. Darrus put on his helmet and activated the air filter. The air in the city was deemed breathable but nobody was taking chances. As Darrus exited the shittle he swiped his hand over a PCI scanner. Every living being had two Personal Chip Insertions (PCIs) on in a forward facing limb, for convience and one implanted near vital organs for security. A PCI contains peronal information, personal credit, medical records, and a list of criminal offences. \r\n\r\nThe ride on the shuttle cost 10,000 credits. A shuttle comute to Stellosia was cheaper than the docking fee he would have to pay for his class C vessel, he would also have to pay for an inspection that he knew he would not pass.\r\n\r\nThe city was dark with smog, lights blarred and flashed dimly to indicate buildings and vehicles. DArrus looked arround him and saw no trace of the other shuttle passangers. He felt alont though he heard voices, sustling, various screachesand bangs as lights whissed past him. Darrus remembered a trick his uncle had taught him once when the pair was swamp fishing for sucker-fish on Epsilon-9. THey were wearing similar helmets as Darrus was wearing now to shield themselves from the thick methane gas that clung to the swamps. When Darrus complained that he could not see the fish, his uncle advised him to activate his night vision to aid his vision in the dense fog.\r\n\r\nDarrus placed his left hand on the side of his helmet and felt for the night vision swich. A bright green light on DArrus’ helmet joined the others in the city nd Darrus; vision was imporved ten fold. Darrus noticed the dozens of beings who were moving arrounf him, scurring from vehicle to vehicle, building to building. Darrus remembered why he was here in this Hellish city, he was here to meer with Uzkashed, a Karian officer that Darrus has befriended some years back. Darrus made his way to an automated taxi service station, swiped his hand over a scanner and entered his thirty difit purchace key and the destination he wished to go to. A taxi pod rose up form a hole in the concrete and a door slid open. Darrus ducked down and slid into the pod. The door shut and the taxi began to rumble and list off the ground. Darrus removed his helmet once the air was filtered out of the taxi.\r\n\r\nThe taxi was cramped and flimsy. The egg shapped vehicle’s body was primarially comprised of a thin transparent material. The rest was a yellow painted metal. After list off the taxi proved to be fast and nimble. Darrus, with his head almost between his knees in the taxi, noticed a holographic screen materialize in front of him. A map of Stallosia began to dissolve into view. By now the pod was speeding above the city. \r\n\r\n“Welcome to Stellosia!”, an artifical female voice greeted him. “You are here.” A red dot on the holographic screen appeared. “If this is your first visit please purchace an air purifing helmet before you leave the cab. Swipe your PCI to buy one for only 1400 credits.” Darrus began to ignore the voice which continued to ramble as the pod sped up to keep with traffic. He wondered where thte helmets were kept in the small pod. \r\n\r\nOccasionally the pod rose above the dark smoke and Darrus could see distant neddle like buildings and flashing lights.\r\n\r\n“Approcahing destination: IOTA Tower. E.T.A. One-hundred and twenty seconds.” By now Darrus was beggining to feel uncomfortable and two minutes felk like an eternity. THe bustling streets below offered more ammusment that the display screen that persisted to annoy him. Suddenly, he emerged form the smoke again, this time in the epicenter of the smokeless expance was a massive building jutting into the sky. He could see hundreds of specks orbiting, entering and exiting the building. White floresent lettering adored the structure. The largest group of letters read “IOTA Intersystems” and the pod was rapidly approaching the “O” in “IOTA”. IOTA INtersystems controlled the production and distribution of credits to the entire galaxy. It was IOTA’s job to keep the value of credits equal on every plannet and to controll inflation an an intergalactic scale. Needless to say, IOTA has been experenceing “economic issues” because last DArrus checked, a shuttle ride doesnt cost 10,000 credits. \r\n\r\n“Brace yourself for deacceleration.”, the artifical voice said sternly as a handle extended out for Darrus to grab. The pod flw through a hole in the building and continued down a brightly lit tunnel. Darrus looked out the left window as hudreds of supporting columns seemed to fly past him. A ten-second countdown appeared on the screen. Darrus held on tightly an as the timer approached zero, several red lights flashed in the cockpit.\r\n\r\nThe pod came to a sudden hault and Darrus felt a pain in his thy emerge as his head was almost forced between his feet. He never was one for daily streaches. After he came to a complete stop, Darrus’ head resumed its place and the door to his left slid open. He rolled out of the pod once the handle retracted. One he stood up the pain in his cramped thy shot up his spine and he became light-headed from standing up too fast.\r\n\r\nShortly Darrus regained sensation to his eyes and streached out his cramp. He rememvered why he had left this city. The inside of the IOTA building was unusually clean considering the mobs of people who were making their way throgh the central station. The floor was white and shiny, as were the walls. It was a plesent break from the filth he had seen since his arrival to Stellosia. The station reminded Darrus of his ship before he lost his crew and oxidation began to set in. He felt a vague sence of familariaty as he seemed to wonder arround looking for an elevator. After bumping shoulders with dozens of strangers and following several signs and billboards Darrus found himself standing in front of a tall glass cylinder that extended partially from the wall, along with a mass of other people waiting for the elevator to arrive. Darrus’ destination was only one floor above the station according to a conveniently placed map of the IOTA Intersystems tower. Darrus thought he could surely walk there in less time than it would take the elevator to reach his floor but the map he was looking at showed no stairwell so he waited patienly. \r\n\r\nAt last a cylinder arose from the floor and the elevator doors opened all at once. Darrus and the others entered the elevator and joined those who were already inside. Darrus positioned himself towards the elevator door. For an easy exit. He scanned the elevator pannel and noticed that floor 657 had already been selected.\r\n\r\nOnce the doors automatically shut the cylinder arose sharply then halted abruptly. The doors reopened and Darrus plus a few others left the capsule. He noticed the dramatic change in environment that had occured between the station floor and this one. Fewer people were moving around. Infact, most were sitting at holographic displays, moving their hands franticlly across touch pads and sensors. Again Darrus used maps to navigate his way yo the floor’s manager’s office. As Darrus approached the door, a booming voice pierced the continous prattle and general rucus produced by the workers and their consoles. \r\n\r\n“I’m sorry, your highness, but you are not in a position to command me to do anything… Your reign does not reach to this plannet.” There was no audible responce as the voice was addressing the recipient in a call. “You will get your credits as long as there are no problems now and our next galactic upload.” Darrus proceeded to approach the door and let himself inside the office. “Yes, I assure you that IOTA is doing everything it can to give Coeille its credits. Just be patient, sir.” Darrus had opened the door carefully so not to interrupt. He began to creep inside. He was greeted by a humanoid figure standing behind a desk, its back to the door. He would have thought it waws human were it not for its slender limbs, hairless scalp and dark blue skin. He was a Karian.\r\n\r\n“Yes sir, I understand. Just be patient, sir. You are in good hands.” Darrus knew the figure must have been talking to a ruller of a human colony because that expression only applies in human cultures. The figure sighed upon ending the call then stood hunched over another desk and mumbled something to himself. \r\n\r\nDarrus made his presence known by clearing his throat. At once the figure turned allowing the light above to shine onto his face. Darrus recognized his features as belonging to his friend Uskashed. \r\n\r\n“Darrus, Captain of the Axis?” Uskashed removed himself from behind his desk and embraced Darrus. “How are you? How is she? Ha Ha! How am I? Estatic that you are here!”\r\n\r\n“I’m fine. The Axis, however…”\r\n\r\n“Don’t tell me you wrecked her.”\r\n\r\n“Nah, almost but no. She’s messed up though. Barely made it here. I was hoping to fix her up while I was here but…”\r\n\r\n“You don’t have enough credits.”\r\n\r\n“Yeah.”\r\n\r\n“Well we’ll get to the credits later, come sit. Tell me how you managed to wreck my ship. Can I get you anything?”\r\n\r\n“No, thanks. I don’t want to keep you from your work.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsence! Here, sit down.”\r\n\r\nDarrus took a seat next to a slender supporting column. He wrapped his arm arround it in an effort of relaxation. \r\n\r\n“So,” Uskashed sighed as he sat opposite of Darrus with a steaming glass in his right hand, “Tell me what happened.”  Darrus could have easlially lied but he knew his friend would understand, and besides, Uskashed has already began to type a credit transfer on his wrist touch pad and his steaming beverage was in a cup holder built into his char. “Well, I was crusing in this system and I recieved a message that the ship’s shields were spotty in certain areas.” Uskashed leaned forward, his large yellow eyes searched Darrus for a speck of falsity. “The ship was on  a steady course so I decided to go sheck the shield distributor underneath the hull.” He looked down again to type more of the credit transfer on his wrist pad. He onlu had fifteen more characters to enter before the transaction was to be completed. Darrus had just gathered his breath to speak the next portion of his story when he heard a woman scream from outside.\r\n\r\nUskashed stood up at once. The Karian was closer to teh door so he approached it while Darrus sued the slender poll to suppoet himself as he began to stand up to offer assistance. Uskashed opened the door and was greeted by a consequent blie flash that caused him to shield his eyes. DArrus was struck with a confusion that amplified as he felt the floor under him become bent and unsturdy. He clenched tightly to the pole just in time to see Uskashed collapse from the trembling. All he heard was fading cries as the entire wall where uskashed had fallen gave way and fell into the dark expanse along with the rest of the floor outside the manager’s office. Uskashed was starting to back up away from the ledge that just formed in front of him. Darrus was now wrapped completely around the pole. A violent wind pelted Darrus as he almost lost his grip and several large objects pelted his body.. His hands and face were unprotected. Darrus was full of confusion. The only thought that occured to him was to hold on and never let go. He tightened his grip in time to feel the floor beneath him crumble and bend toward the windy expanse. Uskashed dug his fingers into the floor which had just been waxed, and slid slowly down the slope of the floor. He caught the threshhold of the door and clamped it with his fingertips as his lower body was being thrashed and flunk by the wind. Darrus wanted to help but if he loosened his grip at all he would be ripped from the pole and flung out of the building. A shift in the wind shook Uskashed’s grip and Darrus watched as his friend was ripped from the building and vanished into the dark clouds. Darrus showed a concerned expression as he starred into the darkness but he felt no pitty or remore. His only feelings surfaced on his face. The chilling wind numbed his bloody hands as he continued to hold the pole tighter.\r\n\r\nThe destruction seemed to slow down after that moment. The building stopped crumbling and the wind became a tolerable annoyance. Darrus remained hanging from the poleand he was beggining to realize that he needed to get down as soon as possible. His life depended on it. He was only human and the muscled that sustained his grip on the pole were begomming sore and weak. The obvious choice was to simply drop down to a lower platform and nameuver through the bulding to escape. He surveyed the rubble and gutted building for possible routes of desention. He spotted another horizontal supporting structure similar to his own but about seven meters below him. It seemed his best option since below that place was an overhanging platform large enough and sturdy enough to walk on. The air around Darrus was becomming hazy due to the polluted air dissapating into the building. He resolved that action should be taken quickly before the air became too thick to see. He tried to let go but hesitated, thinking that fortune would somehow save him should he stay. He prepared again for the dropand unclenched his stiff hands. In mid fall he reached out his arms to grip the pole taking care not to injure himslef in doing so. He impacted the pole with his chest and arms knockeing out his breath. He remained hanging there for a moment to congradualte himself for his efforts and to gain the courage to make another leap onto the platform below him. It was a further drop than the last but was made easier by not having to grasp anythign to save from falling. Darrus lowered himself as close to the platform as he could by hanging from the tips of his sore fingers. He let loose and fell downward slightly off target of where he had wanted to land though still over the platform. Darrus made sure to absorb most of the impact by bending his knees upon contact and following through with a roll where space allowed.\r\n\r\nAs Darrus stood up he noticed that he could maneuver with little disturbance into an unaffected portion of the building. His underlying onfusion of “What the hell just happend?” and his wonderings of Uskashed were still dwarfed by his thoughts and passions of survival. He crawled across exposed beams and moved past deformed and melted structual remains until he entered a corridor that seemed untouched except fot the cracks in the flooring and other signs of destruction. As Darrus stumbled through the hallway he wittnedded dozens of others in a similar state as he. Some in panic. Some in agony. And some dead. The sight of death no longer bothered Darrus, but the sight of pain, agony, and suffering continues to tear his heart. \r\n\r\nAs Darrus made his way to the east facing side of the tower he stumbled upon a field of bodies coating the floor of a major hallway. They appeared to have been trampled to death. Darrus trudged through the marsh. Some of the bodies he stepped on still had life in them and cringed as he walked on their backs. \r\n\r\nAmoung the many twisted bodies and bruised faces that covered the floor, Darrus noticed on concealed by lavish white cloth. All that could be seen were the eyes and the immediatly locked with Darrus’. He hesitated then approached the stranger and knelt beside her. He removed the cloth to reveal a blue face and welcomeing eyes. It was the senator. \r\n\r\n“Senator?” he asked respectfully.\r\n\r\n“Leave me! Go! The bulding may collapse.” Darrus knew this was true. He could feel the floor beneath him ripple on account of the wind swaying the tower.\r\n\r\n“Are you hurt?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my leg… I think its broken.” Darrus had studied the biology of her species. The Karians had a remarkable ability to recover rapidly from bone fractures, but they also have a low pain tolerance. The pain of moving alone may kill her.\r\n\r\nDarrus took the chance and found the strength to hist her onto his sholder and carry her to the nearest emergency exit port. The senator was in terrible pain. The port was linned with hundreds of pads that would have each contained an escape pod. But all were gone. There was however a medium size freight ship preparing for takeoff. “Wait!”, Darrus yelled, “WAIT! WAIT FOR US!” He began running towards the ship. He tried to hold the senator;s broken leg still rto spare her the pain. \r\n\r\nA figure appeared in the bay window of the ship and motioned to DArrus to hurry. Darrus continued running. The port was massive and he was almost there. A large bay door opened on the back of the ship at the same timethe ship began to slowly lift off the ground. Darrus made the jump and was relieved when his feet made solid contact with the floor of the ships bay door. DArrus was greeted in the bay by a man about his age. \r\n\r\n“Is she hurt?”, the man asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I think her leg’s broken.”\r\n\r\n“Lay her down over here.” He began moving toward a room to the right side of the bay. Darrus eagerlly followed. The bay was well lit and Darrus noticed many forms of terrestrial transportaion devices and also a variety of weapons that decorated the walls. Darrus believed that the man was a rouge. On the run from someone. But Darrus did’nt care. He only wanted to ensure that the senator would be alright. Darrus followed the man into the room and placed the senator on a bed.\r\n\r\n“What can I do?”\r\n\r\n“Bring her some water and bandages.”\r\n\r\nThe man rushed out of the room. Darrus knelt beside the bed and noticed the unusual calmness of the senator’s face. She was unconsious. Darrus heard voices echoing through the ship, there were at least four distinct voices. He caught parts of the conversation.\r\n\r\n“We can’t take them where we are going. You know that!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but they must be rich, maybe they’ll compensate us for our troubles.”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t worth them finding out.” This voice was female, sharp and demanding. “We’ll dump them on the nearest system. No exceptions.”\r\n\r\nBy now the ship had left the bay and was leaving the vicinity of the tower. There was a window above the bed and when the ship made a sharp left turn the tower was in view. There was a gaping hole in the upper portion of the tower. Much of it was burning and the top of the tower was cloaked in dense smoke. Darrus had no idea of the extent of the damage until now. He still was not certain of what the cause of the mayhem was. He began pictuing the blue flash that presimented the disaster. He never remembered hearing anything but that woman screaming. Maybe she saw somehting. \r\n\r\nThe floor Darrus was on was above the most catatrophic damage of the building but not by much. It could have been a bomb. It would make sence. The blue flash. The woman screaming. Everything but the silence made perfect sence. \r\n\r\nThe man entered the room with bandages and water in hand. He handed them to Darrus who began wrappin g the senator’s leg. He would save the water until she was consious. “I realize we haven’t been intorduced properly as I suppose is custom.” Darrus turned to look at the man this was the first time he was able to note them man’s appearance. He was tall and thin. He was human, of course, with light skin, brown short hair, mid thirties. He looked tired and sickly. Darrus wasn’t prepared to give the latter so readially. “My name is Conrad McDaniels. Born on Earth raised on a ship. You probably heard the rest oof the crew a while ago.”\r\n\r\n“Yes I did. Who is the captain of this vessel?”\r\n\r\n“Tell em your name first, son.”\r\n\r\n“Darrus. I don’t know my last name.”\r\n\r\n“You sure about that?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Okay, Darrus. Mira runs this ship. She’s got final word about everything that happens here and she says that you and your girlfriend are getting dumped as sson as we land, so don’t get comfy.”\r\n\r\n“That’s fine, we just needed to get off that tower. Anywhere you take us, we would be grateful.” COnrad took a seat on a chair near the bed and crossed his arms while DArrus remained bedside.\r\n\r\n“Did you lose anyone back there?”\r\n\r\n“Yeah, a Karian. His name was Uskashed, a long time friend of mine.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry for you loss.”\r\n\r\n“It’s fine. I only needed him for his credits, and he only tolerated me because I saved his life. Did you see anything? What do you think happened at IOTA?”\r\n\r\n“A bomb, I figure.”\r\n\r\n“A bomb?”\r\n\r\n“It makes sense, you know. All the Inflation with credits, people’s savings being worth less and less. Someone thought it their duty to go and blow up IOTA. Stop the creation of credits for a few days, and maybe be able to buy a meal for his family.” Darrus nodded and noticed the senator’s face scrunch.\r\n\r\n“I think she’s waking up.” \r\n\r\nConrad ignored him, “Of course everybody will see it as a political statement, whoever did it will be a galactic felon. They will search cargo ships looking for hi,. Shut down factory stationsand the price of goods will soar. I guess Mr. Bomb Man didn’t think of that.”\r\n\r\n“If it was a bomb, how come I didn’t hear an explosion?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve been thinking about that as well. I figure someone made a big mistake. Did you see the flash too?”\r\n\r\n“Blue.”\r\n\r\n“Aye, it was not a bomb then but an ion thrust engine probably Class B. THey emmit blue light and put out a literally deafening white noise that drowns out all other sounds. Its made for stealth ships. It was likely on a ship in a bay someshere rigged to blow. THat would explain eerything right?”\r\n\r\n“I guess it would.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll it don’t matter how she blew up, not to us anyways.” \r\n\r\nDarrus began to notice the atmosphere of the freight ship. A stark contrast from the IOTA building. It was rundown and out of date. The air was moaist and mold grew on the walls and corners. \r\n\r\nBy now, the senator had opened her eyes and was starring at Darrus.\r\n\r\n“You…”, she said hoarsly. Darrus discarded his intrigue with Conrad and locked eyes with the pale blue woman who lay before him. “… you were on that shuttle with me.” Darrus nodded. “We were both in IOTA and you saved me.” She started to move but the forgotten pain in her leg reminded her why she needed to be saved in the first place. Conrad spoke up, “No movin’ for you, little miss. Not for a while anyways.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll have you know that I’m a senator.”\r\n\r\n“Well excuse me for not changing my tone when speaking to a lady of dignity. I’ll have you know that I’m the reason you didn’t burn on that godforsaken tower.” Darrus looked at Conrad in astonishment. Conrad looked at Darrus and proded his chest firmly. “I’ll just let you and Miss Prisy Puss catch up.” Darrus and the senator watched him as he stormed out of the room and headed toward the pilot’s bay.\r\n\r\n“What’s his problem?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know.”, said Darrus. “We just met.”\r\n\r\n“Well, anyways, thanks for getting me out of there although next time you could be a bit more gentle. My leg hurts like hell.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll try.” Darrus scoffed. He knew she was joking.\r\n\r\n“My father will likely come and take me home after we dock. ANy idea where we are headed?”\r\n\r\n“The nearest system. I heard them speaking of it. Probably Crysol-Europa.”\r\n\r\n“Well, father will get us once we land.”\r\n\r\n“If we land.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” She had a concerned look on he face.\r\n\r\n“I’m not sure we con trust them. I wasn’t planning on telling them you were a senator. These people look poor and I’m not sure what they were doing at IOTA.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t worry, Love.” a powerful female voice spoke. Darrus and the senator jerked toward the door where a purple skinned Falkmar woman stood leaning against the frame. The Flakmars were a rare species in this sector. They avoided contact with the Karians in the area wo generally segregated them because of the Falkmar Rebellion that occured hundreds of years ago. Tentions were high between the two races.\r\n\r\nThe Falkmar woman began to chuckle as she slowly entered the room. She had a scrunched face with carlike whiskers jutting from her cheekbones. Her dress was nearly non-existent, exposing as much as was socially acceptable. Thick brown fur covered her sholders, arms and legs her hair was sholder-long and wavy. It concealed her ears and one eye the other was nocternal and yellowish. Her body was curved and trim. Darrus would be lying if he said he wasn’t attracted to her. But he vowed long ago he would never mate with another species. That was before he had seen a Falkmar woman.\r\n\r\nThe Falkmar squatted by the bed and began to run her fingers through the senator’s hair in mockery. Darrus heard her wisper something in her ear but could not dicern what it was. Only after that note, the senator’s eyes grew hot with fury. The Falkmar stood and turned at DArrus. She looked him over a few times, tilting her feline head. “I suppose you met Conrad. A cheeky fellow when he’s not being corrected by a spoiled aristocrat.”, she continued, “You should have seen my face when it came to my knowldge that we had a Karian on board.” Darrus began to speak but she cut him off. “Don’t worry we will drop you two off on the nearest system. If this Karian can keep her head from getting too big we will all get along peachy.” She smiled at Darrus and turned for the door. As she strode off, her fury tail brushed under Darrus’ chin. Scilence remained until her footsteps were unheard outside the door.\r\n\r\n“Some bitch!”, the senator remarked. “Even for a dirty Falkmar. She had eyes for you though. That’s not something to be proud of.” \r\n\r\n“I - -”, agian before Darrus could start, the only dooe in the small room slamed shit and locked. \r\n“The fact that you think I can’t ear you shows plainly how foolish you are.” Mira’s voice screeched through some hidden speaker in the room. “You are not in a position to insult. You are on MY ship in MY hands. You will stay here until be dock.” There was a pause followed by minutes of steady breathing and the hum of the ships engine.\r\n\r\n“How’s you leg?” Darrus finially asked.\r\n\r\n“Its healing. I can feel the muscles aligning the bone. I may faint again once the bone begins to refuse.”\r\n\r\n“I’m glad you’re improving. Ought to be better by the time we land?”\r\n\r\n“We’ll see.”\r\n\r\nA bump was heard from deep within the floor followed by a jolt that rocked the room. The senator had to brace to keep from falling out of the bed. The ship’s engine whirred faster and the staes outside the bay window began to move by daster. Darrus reached inside his white captin’s coat and removed an electronic tablet. After consulting the device he estimated that they would arrive on Crysol-Europa in 3-4 hours. Darrus had to censor all converstaion with the senator. HE could not speak of their intentions once they landed nor anything to give them a reason not to let them go freely. Darrus put the tablet on a table by where he sat and took an inventory of the items he had to see what he may have lost durring the IOTA incident. He took everything out of his pockets and carring bags and placed it all on the table. Although he was sitting, he felt less encumbered to see the dozen or so items that lay on the table next to him. His tablet, of course, a pack of dried food, a survival knife, a universal tool kit, a broken compass passed to him from his foster parrent, a small glass jar full of glowing yellow dirt, his collapsable helmet and respirator, a shain containing various metal identification plates, a digital scope, a foldable solar sharger with universal plugs, and a small paper notebook and an antique ink pen for noting things he didnt want to be archived. He had onlu lost a hair comb and a silver coin he found yesterday on the deck of his ship. For all he knew those items were stolen from him when he left the shuttle and was momentary blind from the smig. He would have been a prime target for any pickpocket. He took off his captain’s jacket and hanged it on the backing of his char. He glanced at the senator who lay with eyes closed. She was unconsious again. \r\n\r\nHe picked up the tablet to search for the prices of food and lodging on Crysol-Europa to see if his credits were sufficient in casr he had to stay for any length of time. He caught glimpse of the notification on the finance icon on his tablet screen. HE touched it and was greeted by a message declaring, “You recieved 15,000,000 Cr from Uskashed Kisol. View payment message? Yes/no” Darrus’ heart stopped. He reread the message to ensure it was correct. He assumed Uskashed was unable to send the payment. He must have finished sending the money while in freefall. Whas it possible that uskashed had somehow survived? Darrus tapped “Yes” to view the message which read. “fix ship find st” followed by an automated note reading “:message was sent automatically due to 5 minutes of inactivity. ” This suggested that USkashed was in fact dead and was unable to finish the messagebefore he hit the surface of teh streats below. \r\n\r\nDarrus did not care much for Uskashed. He was only a friend to Darrus because he was not an enemy. Uskashed kept in touch to check on the status of his ship which he gave to Darrus. He was fond of Uskashed’s hreatfullness and generosity but never cared for the man himself. Finacially, everything was looking up for Darrus. He had the funds to repair his ship and hire a new crew. This was made better by the fact that Uskashed was dead. He would never hsve to repay his debt. His future was lighting up before his eyes. First he would repair his ship, then travel to a few systems and recruit dome ship hands. He would earn additional credits, of course, he would sell his services to anyone willing to pay. He and his crew would scavange the galaxy searching for jobs and gaining recognition on a galactic scale. \r\n\r\nThe racing thoughts passing through his head made the time pass by more quickly.\r\n\r\n“How’s it look?” Darrus snapped back to reality.\r\n\r\n“Huh?”\r\n\r\n“How does it look?” The senator was awake on the bed and was pointing at her leg. \r\n\r\n“Swollen.”\r\n\r\n“Could you take off the bandage?” Darrus stood and knelt beside the bed by her leg.\r\n\r\n“Can you lift it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Hand me a pillow.” She passed him a pillow and raised her leg. Darrus placed the pillow under her thigh. He unwrapped the bandage making circular movements over and under the injured calf. As skin began to show, Darrus noticed its swolleness and peculiar pulsing and purple color. \r\n\r\n“Its purple and beating like a heart.”\r\n\r\n“Good. I think the structure is repaired. Its being strengthened and the tissue is reattaching to the bone.” The senator said in relief.\r\n\r\n“Will you be able to walk soon?”\r\n\r\n“Likely. Within an hour or so.”\r\n\r\n“It’s amazing how fast your kind can heal.” He said as he stood and faced the door opposite the bed. “Its a shame that the Karian genome is rejected by the human chromosomes. I remember reading the histories. We has suspition that your kind was the key to our immortality.” Darrus looked out the small peephole in the thick metal door. “I never was one for genetic augmentaion. It never turns out good for anyone. I thought it humorous that it was you kinf that pished the hardest for altering genes and causing mutation given your rick past of morals from your ancient ancestors.” Darrus paused, took in a deep breath through his nose and released from his mouth loudly. “The human soul is cursed with instability. We are never satisfied with waht we have. When we see somethign better or someone with something better, we can’t help but want it. Its in our bones, we crave improvement but are too blind to go about getting it the right way.” A loud clank in the ship’s hull and a quick flicker of the interior lights. Darrus continued, “If we catch what we were chasing, its never enough we’ll just chase the next think till we catch it or it kills us.” Lights in the room flashed yellow three times. “The saddest part of our condition is we never know we have a problem but nobody never tries to do anything to fix it.”\r\n\r\nThe senator sensed the tense moment and waited for DArrus to walk back to his chair, remove his coat from the chair and put it on. She watched him sling the rearly covering over his sholder and worm his arms through the shiny sleaves. “We’ve entered atmosphere.” She said.\r\n\r\n“I know.” He began shelving his possesions back into his pockets and poped his collar. Moments passed in absolute scilence. Darrus took out his tablet and poked and slid his index finger across the screen. Darrus was starring at his credit balance, saying the number in his head. “Fifteen million forty-six thousand nine hundred and eighty two.” Repair costs about two-million. Freshly charged fuel cell seventy-five thousand. That leaved me about thirteen million to get a start on things. The senator sat up and tested the strength of her leg on the floor. \r\n\r\n“How is it?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll be fine to walk if I take it easy. Back to normal soon.” \r\n\r\nJust then the door slid into the wall in a snap and Darrus turned to look outside. He saw teh Falkmar standing with two men near teh bay doors. Her thin purple arm raised toward Darrus and motioned for them to come by curing her index finger. Darrus turned his head to the senator who by now had positioned herself to see out of the door. “Come on.” He said, “I think we’re getting off.” The senator stood.\r\n\r\n“Right you are.”, the Falkmar’s voice echoed through the bay. “Let’s go. You’ll hurry if you know what’s good for you.”, She said snarly. The senator walked to Darrus and the pair left the room and approached the Dalkmar. Upon their jouney the bay doors cracked and began to fold open. “Stand here please.” one of the men beside her demanded. He motioned at a red line just in front of the bay opening. “Dawn is approaching. You will need to find cover soon.” The Falkmar looked disdainfully at the senator. “It would be a shame id the Karian got toased berore her dear father could rescue her.” She chucked. By now, the doors had fully opened and cool air rushed in the bay whipping the loose flaps of Darrus’ jacket. The view outside was hazy, the light was pinkish-puple and the horizon was perfectly peabolic in shape. The ship was descending and more and more of the sandy ground beneath them was visible each passing second. Darrus and the senator stood just a few feet from the edge of the bay. Just a brisk step and they would have fallen out of the ship. The ship was now only a few feet from the surface. Darrus felt a pressure impending on his rear then found himself without ballance and falling out of the ship. He hit the sandy earth below with a thud and looked to his left where the senator lay as hi, on her face in the sand. The roar of the ship’s engines was deffening. Darrus turned while laying on his front and looked at the bay opening of the ship. The Falkmar bent over the ledge, blew the pair a kiss, smiled and waved her hand as the ship elevated and accelerated out of view.\r\n\r\nDarrus stood without trouble and assisted teh senator to her feet. “You ok?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my leg is fine. It still hurts but I’ll be fine.”\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere was hazy and it burned the throat to breathe.“We need to find shelter. Look for somethign sticking ut of the sand. The sun is hot as Hell. It’ll fry us if we stay outside. ” Darrus looked east. “We’ve got maybe ten minutes till she starts rising. Let’s go toward those dunes.” He pointedwest where a group of hills lay gleamingin the pink haze. The two began movinf to the dunes as quick as they were able. The loose sand slipped under their feet making it difficult to make any noticable speed. They reached the base of a small dune and climbed it, flinging scoops of sand and dust behind them. Once on top of the dune, Darrus looked over his sholder and was greeted by a glistening ruby cresent inching above the horizon. Even though the dense haze, it was already bright enough to burn his eyes. He looked all around, pale tired eyes squinting. His hand on his brow to shield the rising sun. Through the dust he saw a dark sylinderjutting from the sanda good distance away. He pointed , “There! Hurry the sun is risingfater now.” He led the way sliding down the sandy slope as the senator followed. At the bottom of the slope Darrus stumbled but was able to regain his posture withthe weight if his arms. The senator began to stumble likewise but he braced her and the two began treking through the sand.\r\n\r\nDArrus could feel the sand filling in his boots but it diddnt matter now. All that mattered was speed. THe cylinder they were chasing may be blocked off. Then what? He would have to find another one or be burned alive. There was no shade, no trees just sand and the dunes would do little to block the sun. IT was higher now Darrus felt the heat on his back. His eyes were fixed on the cylinder when he stumbled in the cumbersome sand. Only then did he loose sight for a second. \r\n\r\nThe sand in forn tof him grew redder and his shadow became more distinct from the lighted sand arround it. Darrus knew the sun was rising fat. He felt the heat on his neck increase by degree. He darred not look at it, his eyes on the cylinder. “What if this one’s blocked?”, He thought. The senator kept pase with Darrus, they were both panting heavailly and almost out of breath but the intense heat of the red sun pushed them on. Darrus began to see details about the sylinder. Engraved on the side going along the length of the tube were letters reading “ENTE” the rest was covered with sand. The last letter almost indecisive, it could wasially be a “B” if out of context. The cylinder was indeed a pipe protruding from the sand at an angle with a metal stair case leading to the opening. They had reached the pipe and turned to climb the stairs. DArrus felt the burning sun on the right side of his face. It singed his whiskers as he cranked open the vault door in front of  the large metal pipe. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}, "commit"=>"Create Note"}

The lights in the shittle flashed yellow to indicate atmosphere entry. \r\n\r\n“I have taken lives, but I am not a murderer.”\r\n\r\nA neighboring passenger who sat to his right cleared his throat loudly. \r\n\r\n“I dont work for anyone, not a soldier or an assassian.”\r\n\r\nDarrus loked out the suttle’s bay window and saw a black mist sourounding the city.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps I should be an assassian, there are many overloards willing to hire. It would pay very well.”\r\n\r\nThe being who sat adjacent to DArrus was a young female Karian with beautiful blue skin. DArrus remembered reading of the first encounter with Karians and humans. As the historical text read, “The Karians gave us technology we gave them philosophy.” \r\n\r\nShe wore ceremonial Karian roves which suggested governemnt status and wealth. She was a senator. \r\n\r\nThe lights tured blue and the shuttle doors opened and the black fog began to enter the doors and fill the shuttle. Darrus put on his helmet and activated the air filter. The air in the city was deemed breathable but nobody was taking chances. As Darrus exited the shittle he swiped his hand over a PCI scanner. Every living being had two Personal Chip Insertions (PCIs) on in a forward facing limb, for convience and one implanted near vital organs for security. A PCI contains peronal information, personal credit, medical records, and a list of criminal offences. \r\n\r\nThe ride on the shuttle cost 10,000 credits. A shuttle comute to Stellosia was cheaper than the docking fee he would have to pay for his class C vessel, he would also have to pay for an inspection that he knew he would not pass.\r\n\r\nThe city was dark with smog, lights blarred and flashed dimly to indicate buildings and vehicles. DArrus looked arround him and saw no trace of the other shuttle passangers. He felt alont though he heard voices, sustling, various screachesand bangs as lights whissed past him. Darrus remembered a trick his uncle had taught him once when the pair was swamp fishing for sucker-fish on Epsilon-9. THey were wearing similar helmets as Darrus was wearing now to shield themselves from the thick methane gas that clung to the swamps. When Darrus complained that he could not see the fish, his uncle advised him to activate his night vision to aid his vision in the dense fog.\r\n\r\nDarrus placed his left hand on the side of his helmet and felt for the night vision swich. A bright green light on DArrus’ helmet joined the others in the city nd Darrus; vision was imporved ten fold. Darrus noticed the dozens of beings who were moving arrounf him, scurring from vehicle to vehicle, building to building. Darrus remembered why he was here in this Hellish city, he was here to meer with Uzkashed, a Karian officer that Darrus has befriended some years back. Darrus made his way to an automated taxi service station, swiped his hand over a scanner and entered his thirty difit purchace key and the destination he wished to go to. A taxi pod rose up form a hole in the concrete and a door slid open. Darrus ducked down and slid into the pod. The door shut and the taxi began to rumble and list off the ground. Darrus removed his helmet once the air was filtered out of the taxi.\r\n\r\nThe taxi was cramped and flimsy. The egg shapped vehicle’s body was primarially comprised of a thin transparent material. The rest was a yellow painted metal. After list off the taxi proved to be fast and nimble. Darrus, with his head almost between his knees in the taxi, noticed a holographic screen materialize in front of him. A map of Stallosia began to dissolve into view. By now the pod was speeding above the city. \r\n\r\n“Welcome to Stellosia!”, an artifical female voice greeted him. “You are here.” A red dot on the holographic screen appeared. “If this is your first visit please purchace an air purifing helmet before you leave the cab. Swipe your PCI to buy one for only 1400 credits.” Darrus began to ignore the voice which continued to ramble as the pod sped up to keep with traffic. He wondered where thte helmets were kept in the small pod. \r\n\r\nOccasionally the pod rose above the dark smoke and Darrus could see distant neddle like buildings and flashing lights.\r\n\r\n“Approcahing destination: IOTA Tower. E.T.A. One-hundred and twenty seconds.” By now Darrus was beggining to feel uncomfortable and two minutes felk like an eternity. THe bustling streets below offered more ammusment that the display screen that persisted to annoy him. Suddenly, he emerged form the smoke again, this time in the epicenter of the smokeless expance was a massive building jutting into the sky. He could see hundreds of specks orbiting, entering and exiting the building. White floresent lettering adored the structure. The largest group of letters read “IOTA Intersystems” and the pod was rapidly approaching the “O” in “IOTA”. IOTA INtersystems controlled the production and distribution of credits to the entire galaxy. It was IOTA’s job to keep the value of credits equal on every plannet and to controll inflation an an intergalactic scale. Needless to say, IOTA has been experenceing “economic issues” because last DArrus checked, a shuttle ride doesnt cost 10,000 credits. \r\n\r\n“Brace yourself for deacceleration.”, the artifical voice said sternly as a handle extended out for Darrus to grab. The pod flw through a hole in the building and continued down a brightly lit tunnel. Darrus looked out the left window as hudreds of supporting columns seemed to fly past him. A ten-second countdown appeared on the screen. Darrus held on tightly an as the timer approached zero, several red lights flashed in the cockpit.\r\n\r\nThe pod came to a sudden hault and Darrus felt a pain in his thy emerge as his head was almost forced between his feet. He never was one for daily streaches. After he came to a complete stop, Darrus’ head resumed its place and the door to his left slid open. He rolled out of the pod once the handle retracted. One he stood up the pain in his cramped thy shot up his spine and he became light-headed from standing up too fast.\r\n\r\nShortly Darrus regained sensation to his eyes and streached out his cramp. He rememvered why he had left this city. The inside of the IOTA building was unusually clean considering the mobs of people who were making their way throgh the central station. The floor was white and shiny, as were the walls. It was a plesent break from the filth he had seen since his arrival to Stellosia. The station reminded Darrus of his ship before he lost his crew and oxidation began to set in. He felt a vague sence of familariaty as he seemed to wonder arround looking for an elevator. After bumping shoulders with dozens of strangers and following several signs and billboards Darrus found himself standing in front of a tall glass cylinder that extended partially from the wall, along with a mass of other people waiting for the elevator to arrive. Darrus’ destination was only one floor above the station according to a conveniently placed map of the IOTA Intersystems tower. Darrus thought he could surely walk there in less time than it would take the elevator to reach his floor but the map he was looking at showed no stairwell so he waited patienly. \r\n\r\nAt last a cylinder arose from the floor and the elevator doors opened all at once. Darrus and the others entered the elevator and joined those who were already inside. Darrus positioned himself towards the elevator door. For an easy exit. He scanned the elevator pannel and noticed that floor 657 had already been selected.\r\n\r\nOnce the doors automatically shut the cylinder arose sharply then halted abruptly. The doors reopened and Darrus plus a few others left the capsule. He noticed the dramatic change in environment that had occured between the station floor and this one. Fewer people were moving around. Infact, most were sitting at holographic displays, moving their hands franticlly across touch pads and sensors. Again Darrus used maps to navigate his way yo the floor’s manager’s office. As Darrus approached the door, a booming voice pierced the continous prattle and general rucus produced by the workers and their consoles. \r\n\r\n“I’m sorry, your highness, but you are not in a position to command me to do anything… Your reign does not reach to this plannet.” There was no audible responce as the voice was addressing the recipient in a call. “You will get your credits as long as there are no problems now and our next galactic upload.” Darrus proceeded to approach the door and let himself inside the office. “Yes, I assure you that IOTA is doing everything it can to give Coeille its credits. Just be patient, sir.” Darrus had opened the door carefully so not to interrupt. He began to creep inside. He was greeted by a humanoid figure standing behind a desk, its back to the door. He would have thought it waws human were it not for its slender limbs, hairless scalp and dark blue skin. He was a Karian.\r\n\r\n“Yes sir, I understand. Just be patient, sir. You are in good hands.” Darrus knew the figure must have been talking to a ruller of a human colony because that expression only applies in human cultures. The figure sighed upon ending the call then stood hunched over another desk and mumbled something to himself. \r\n\r\nDarrus made his presence known by clearing his throat. At once the figure turned allowing the light above to shine onto his face. Darrus recognized his features as belonging to his friend Uskashed. \r\n\r\n“Darrus, Captain of the Axis?” Uskashed removed himself from behind his desk and embraced Darrus. “How are you? How is she? Ha Ha! How am I? Estatic that you are here!”\r\n\r\n“I’m fine. The Axis, however…”\r\n\r\n“Don’t tell me you wrecked her.”\r\n\r\n“Nah, almost but no. She’s messed up though. Barely made it here. I was hoping to fix her up while I was here but…”\r\n\r\n“You don’t have enough credits.”\r\n\r\n“Yeah.”\r\n\r\n“Well we’ll get to the credits later, come sit. Tell me how you managed to wreck my ship. Can I get you anything?”\r\n\r\n“No, thanks. I don’t want to keep you from your work.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsence! Here, sit down.”\r\n\r\nDarrus took a seat next to a slender supporting column. He wrapped his arm arround it in an effort of relaxation. \r\n\r\n“So,” Uskashed sighed as he sat opposite of Darrus with a steaming glass in his right hand, “Tell me what happened.”  Darrus could have easlially lied but he knew his friend would understand, and besides, Uskashed has already began to type a credit transfer on his wrist touch pad and his steaming beverage was in a cup holder built into his char. “Well, I was crusing in this system and I recieved a message that the ship’s shields were spotty in certain areas.” Uskashed leaned forward, his large yellow eyes searched Darrus for a speck of falsity. “The ship was on  a steady course so I decided to go sheck the shield distributor underneath the hull.” He looked down again to type more of the credit transfer on his wrist pad. He onlu had fifteen more characters to enter before the transaction was to be completed. Darrus had just gathered his breath to speak the next portion of his story when he heard a woman scream from outside.\r\n\r\nUskashed stood up at once. The Karian was closer to teh door so he approached it while Darrus sued the slender poll to suppoet himself as he began to stand up to offer assistance. Uskashed opened the door and was greeted by a consequent blie flash that caused him to shield his eyes. DArrus was struck with a confusion that amplified as he felt the floor under him become bent and unsturdy. He clenched tightly to the pole just in time to see Uskashed collapse from the trembling. All he heard was fading cries as the entire wall where uskashed had fallen gave way and fell into the dark expanse along with the rest of the floor outside the manager’s office. Uskashed was starting to back up away from the ledge that just formed in front of him. Darrus was now wrapped completely around the pole. A violent wind pelted Darrus as he almost lost his grip and several large objects pelted his body.. His hands and face were unprotected. Darrus was full of confusion. The only thought that occured to him was to hold on and never let go. He tightened his grip in time to feel the floor beneath him crumble and bend toward the windy expanse. Uskashed dug his fingers into the floor which had just been waxed, and slid slowly down the slope of the floor. He caught the threshhold of the door and clamped it with his fingertips as his lower body was being thrashed and flunk by the wind. Darrus wanted to help but if he loosened his grip at all he would be ripped from the pole and flung out of the building. A shift in the wind shook Uskashed’s grip and Darrus watched as his friend was ripped from the building and vanished into the dark clouds. Darrus showed a concerned expression as he starred into the darkness but he felt no pitty or remore. His only feelings surfaced on his face. The chilling wind numbed his bloody hands as he continued to hold the pole tighter.\r\n\r\nThe destruction seemed to slow down after that moment. The building stopped crumbling and the wind became a tolerable annoyance. Darrus remained hanging from the poleand he was beggining to realize that he needed to get down as soon as possible. His life depended on it. He was only human and the muscled that sustained his grip on the pole were begomming sore and weak. The obvious choice was to simply drop down to a lower platform and nameuver through the bulding to escape. He surveyed the rubble and gutted building for possible routes of desention. He spotted another horizontal supporting structure similar to his own but about seven meters below him. It seemed his best option since below that place was an overhanging platform large enough and sturdy enough to walk on. The air around Darrus was becomming hazy due to the polluted air dissapating into the building. He resolved that action should be taken quickly before the air became too thick to see. He tried to let go but hesitated, thinking that fortune would somehow save him should he stay. He prepared again for the dropand unclenched his stiff hands. In mid fall he reached out his arms to grip the pole taking care not to injure himslef in doing so. He impacted the pole with his chest and arms knockeing out his breath. He remained hanging there for a moment to congradualte himself for his efforts and to gain the courage to make another leap onto the platform below him. It was a further drop than the last but was made easier by not having to grasp anythign to save from falling. Darrus lowered himself as close to the platform as he could by hanging from the tips of his sore fingers. He let loose and fell downward slightly off target of where he had wanted to land though still over the platform. Darrus made sure to absorb most of the impact by bending his knees upon contact and following through with a roll where space allowed.\r\n\r\nAs Darrus stood up he noticed that he could maneuver with little disturbance into an unaffected portion of the building. His underlying onfusion of “What the hell just happend?” and his wonderings of Uskashed were still dwarfed by his thoughts and passions of survival. He crawled across exposed beams and moved past deformed and melted structual remains until he entered a corridor that seemed untouched except fot the cracks in the flooring and other signs of destruction. As Darrus stumbled through the hallway he wittnedded dozens of others in a similar state as he. Some in panic. Some in agony. And some dead. The sight of death no longer bothered Darrus, but the sight of pain, agony, and suffering continues to tear his heart. \r\n\r\nAs Darrus made his way to the east facing side of the tower he stumbled upon a field of bodies coating the floor of a major hallway. They appeared to have been trampled to death. Darrus trudged through the marsh. Some of the bodies he stepped on still had life in them and cringed as he walked on their backs. \r\n\r\nAmoung the many twisted bodies and bruised faces that covered the floor, Darrus noticed on concealed by lavish white cloth. All that could be seen were the eyes and the immediatly locked with Darrus’. He hesitated then approached the stranger and knelt beside her. He removed the cloth to reveal a blue face and welcomeing eyes. It was the senator. \r\n\r\n“Senator?” he asked respectfully.\r\n\r\n“Leave me! Go! The bulding may collapse.” Darrus knew this was true. He could feel the floor beneath him ripple on account of the wind swaying the tower.\r\n\r\n“Are you hurt?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my leg… I think its broken.” Darrus had studied the biology of her species. The Karians had a remarkable ability to recover rapidly from bone fractures, but they also have a low pain tolerance. The pain of moving alone may kill her.\r\n\r\nDarrus took the chance and found the strength to hist her onto his sholder and carry her to the nearest emergency exit port. The senator was in terrible pain. The port was linned with hundreds of pads that would have each contained an escape pod. But all were gone. There was however a medium size freight ship preparing for takeoff. “Wait!”, Darrus yelled, “WAIT! WAIT FOR US!” He began running towards the ship. He tried to hold the senator;s broken leg still rto spare her the pain. \r\n\r\nA figure appeared in the bay window of the ship and motioned to DArrus to hurry. Darrus continued running. The port was massive and he was almost there. A large bay door opened on the back of the ship at the same timethe ship began to slowly lift off the ground. Darrus made the jump and was relieved when his feet made solid contact with the floor of the ships bay door. DArrus was greeted in the bay by a man about his age. \r\n\r\n“Is she hurt?”, the man asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I think her leg’s broken.”\r\n\r\n“Lay her down over here.” He began moving toward a room to the right side of the bay. Darrus eagerlly followed. The bay was well lit and Darrus noticed many forms of terrestrial transportaion devices and also a variety of weapons that decorated the walls. Darrus believed that the man was a rouge. On the run from someone. But Darrus did’nt care. He only wanted to ensure that the senator would be alright. Darrus followed the man into the room and placed the senator on a bed.\r\n\r\n“What can I do?”\r\n\r\n“Bring her some water and bandages.”\r\n\r\nThe man rushed out of the room. Darrus knelt beside the bed and noticed the unusual calmness of the senator’s face. She was unconsious. Darrus heard voices echoing through the ship, there were at least four distinct voices. He caught parts of the conversation.\r\n\r\n“We can’t take them where we are going. You know that!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but they must be rich, maybe they’ll compensate us for our troubles.”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t worth them finding out.” This voice was female, sharp and demanding. “We’ll dump them on the nearest system. No exceptions.”\r\n\r\nBy now the ship had left the bay and was leaving the vicinity of the tower. There was a window above the bed and when the ship made a sharp left turn the tower was in view. There was a gaping hole in the upper portion of the tower. Much of it was burning and the top of the tower was cloaked in dense smoke. Darrus had no idea of the extent of the damage until now. He still was not certain of what the cause of the mayhem was. He began pictuing the blue flash that presimented the disaster. He never remembered hearing anything but that woman screaming. Maybe she saw somehting. \r\n\r\nThe floor Darrus was on was above the most catatrophic damage of the building but not by much. It could have been a bomb. It would make sence. The blue flash. The woman screaming. Everything but the silence made perfect sence. \r\n\r\nThe man entered the room with bandages and water in hand. He handed them to Darrus who began wrappin g the senator’s leg. He would save the water until she was consious. “I realize we haven’t been intorduced properly as I suppose is custom.” Darrus turned to look at the man this was the first time he was able to note them man’s appearance. He was tall and thin. He was human, of course, with light skin, brown short hair, mid thirties. He looked tired and sickly. Darrus wasn’t prepared to give the latter so readially. “My name is Conrad McDaniels. Born on Earth raised on a ship. You probably heard the rest oof the crew a while ago.”\r\n\r\n“Yes I did. Who is the captain of this vessel?”\r\n\r\n“Tell em your name first, son.”\r\n\r\n“Darrus. I don’t know my last name.”\r\n\r\n“You sure about that?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Okay, Darrus. Mira runs this ship. She’s got final word about everything that happens here and she says that you and your girlfriend are getting dumped as sson as we land, so don’t get comfy.”\r\n\r\n“That’s fine, we just needed to get off that tower. Anywhere you take us, we would be grateful.” COnrad took a seat on a chair near the bed and crossed his arms while DArrus remained bedside.\r\n\r\n“Did you lose anyone back there?”\r\n\r\n“Yeah, a Karian. His name was Uskashed, a long time friend of mine.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry for you loss.”\r\n\r\n“It’s fine. I only needed him for his credits, and he only tolerated me because I saved his life. Did you see anything? What do you think happened at IOTA?”\r\n\r\n“A bomb, I figure.”\r\n\r\n“A bomb?”\r\n\r\n“It makes sense, you know. All the Inflation with credits, people’s savings being worth less and less. Someone thought it their duty to go and blow up IOTA. Stop the creation of credits for a few days, and maybe be able to buy a meal for his family.” Darrus nodded and noticed the senator’s face scrunch.\r\n\r\n“I think she’s waking up.” \r\n\r\nConrad ignored him, “Of course everybody will see it as a political statement, whoever did it will be a galactic felon. They will search cargo ships looking for hi,. Shut down factory stationsand the price of goods will soar. I guess Mr. Bomb Man didn’t think of that.”\r\n\r\n“If it was a bomb, how come I didn’t hear an explosion?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve been thinking about that as well. I figure someone made a big mistake. Did you see the flash too?”\r\n\r\n“Blue.”\r\n\r\n“Aye, it was not a bomb then but an ion thrust engine probably Class B. THey emmit blue light and put out a literally deafening white noise that drowns out all other sounds. Its made for stealth ships. It was likely on a ship in a bay someshere rigged to blow. THat would explain eerything right?”\r\n\r\n“I guess it would.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll it don’t matter how she blew up, not to us anyways.” \r\n\r\nDarrus began to notice the atmosphere of the freight ship. A stark contrast from the IOTA building. It was rundown and out of date. The air was moaist and mold grew on the walls and corners. \r\n\r\nBy now, the senator had opened her eyes and was starring at Darrus.\r\n\r\n“You…”, she said hoarsly. Darrus discarded his intrigue with Conrad and locked eyes with the pale blue woman who lay before him. “… you were on that shuttle with me.” Darrus nodded. “We were both in IOTA and you saved me.” She started to move but the forgotten pain in her leg reminded her why she needed to be saved in the first place. Conrad spoke up, “No movin’ for you, little miss. Not for a while anyways.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll have you know that I’m a senator.”\r\n\r\n“Well excuse me for not changing my tone when speaking to a lady of dignity. I’ll have you know that I’m the reason you didn’t burn on that godforsaken tower.” Darrus looked at Conrad in astonishment. Conrad looked at Darrus and proded his chest firmly. “I’ll just let you and Miss Prisy Puss catch up.” Darrus and the senator watched him as he stormed out of the room and headed toward the pilot’s bay.\r\n\r\n“What’s his problem?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know.”, said Darrus. “We just met.”\r\n\r\n“Well, anyways, thanks for getting me out of there although next time you could be a bit more gentle. My leg hurts like hell.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll try.” Darrus scoffed. He knew she was joking.\r\n\r\n“My father will likely come and take me home after we dock. ANy idea where we are headed?”\r\n\r\n“The nearest system. I heard them speaking of it. Probably Crysol-Europa.”\r\n\r\n“Well, father will get us once we land.”\r\n\r\n“If we land.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” She had a concerned look on he face.\r\n\r\n“I’m not sure we con trust them. I wasn’t planning on telling them you were a senator. These people look poor and I’m not sure what they were doing at IOTA.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t worry, Love.” a powerful female voice spoke. Darrus and the senator jerked toward the door where a purple skinned Falkmar woman stood leaning against the frame. The Flakmars were a rare species in this sector. They avoided contact with the Karians in the area wo generally segregated them because of the Falkmar Rebellion that occured hundreds of years ago. Tentions were high between the two races.\r\n\r\nThe Falkmar woman began to chuckle as she slowly entered the room. She had a scrunched face with carlike whiskers jutting from her cheekbones. Her dress was nearly non-existent, exposing as much as was socially acceptable. Thick brown fur covered her sholders, arms and legs her hair was sholder-long and wavy. It concealed her ears and one eye the other was nocternal and yellowish. Her body was curved and trim. Darrus would be lying if he said he wasn’t attracted to her. But he vowed long ago he would never mate with another species. That was before he had seen a Falkmar woman.\r\n\r\nThe Falkmar squatted by the bed and began to run her fingers through the senator’s hair in mockery. Darrus heard her wisper something in her ear but could not dicern what it was. Only after that note, the senator’s eyes grew hot with fury. The Falkmar stood and turned at DArrus. She looked him over a few times, tilting her feline head. “I suppose you met Conrad. A cheeky fellow when he’s not being corrected by a spoiled aristocrat.”, she continued, “You should have seen my face when it came to my knowldge that we had a Karian on board.” Darrus began to speak but she cut him off. “Don’t worry we will drop you two off on the nearest system. If this Karian can keep her head from getting too big we will all get along peachy.” She smiled at Darrus and turned for the door. As she strode off, her fury tail brushed under Darrus’ chin. Scilence remained until her footsteps were unheard outside the door.\r\n\r\n“Some bitch!”, the senator remarked. “Even for a dirty Falkmar. She had eyes for you though. That’s not something to be proud of.” \r\n\r\n“I - -”, agian before Darrus could start, the only dooe in the small room slamed shit and locked. \r\n“The fact that you think I can’t ear you shows plainly how foolish you are.” Mira’s voice screeched through some hidden speaker in the room. “You are not in a position to insult. You are on MY ship in MY hands. You will stay here until be dock.” There was a pause followed by minutes of steady breathing and the hum of the ships engine.\r\n\r\n“How’s you leg?” Darrus finially asked.\r\n\r\n“Its healing. I can feel the muscles aligning the bone. I may faint again once the bone begins to refuse.”\r\n\r\n“I’m glad you’re improving. Ought to be better by the time we land?”\r\n\r\n“We’ll see.”\r\n\r\nA bump was heard from deep within the floor followed by a jolt that rocked the room. The senator had to brace to keep from falling out of the bed. The ship’s engine whirred faster and the staes outside the bay window began to move by daster. Darrus reached inside his white captin’s coat and removed an electronic tablet. After consulting the device he estimated that they would arrive on Crysol-Europa in 3-4 hours. Darrus had to censor all converstaion with the senator. HE could not speak of their intentions once they landed nor anything to give them a reason not to let them go freely. Darrus put the tablet on a table by where he sat and took an inventory of the items he had to see what he may have lost durring the IOTA incident. He took everything out of his pockets and carring bags and placed it all on the table. Although he was sitting, he felt less encumbered to see the dozen or so items that lay on the table next to him. His tablet, of course, a pack of dried food, a survival knife, a universal tool kit, a broken compass passed to him from his foster parrent, a small glass jar full of glowing yellow dirt, his collapsable helmet and respirator, a shain containing various metal identification plates, a digital scope, a foldable solar sharger with universal plugs, and a small paper notebook and an antique ink pen for noting things he didnt want to be archived. He had onlu lost a hair comb and a silver coin he found yesterday on the deck of his ship. For all he knew those items were stolen from him when he left the shuttle and was momentary blind from the smig. He would have been a prime target for any pickpocket. He took off his captain’s jacket and hanged it on the backing of his char. He glanced at the senator who lay with eyes closed. She was unconsious again. \r\n\r\nHe picked up the tablet to search for the prices of food and lodging on Crysol-Europa to see if his credits were sufficient in casr he had to stay for any length of time. He caught glimpse of the notification on the finance icon on his tablet screen. HE touched it and was greeted by a message declaring, “You recieved 15,000,000 Cr from Uskashed Kisol. View payment message? Yes/no” Darrus’ heart stopped. He reread the message to ensure it was correct. He assumed Uskashed was unable to send the payment. He must have finished sending the money while in freefall. Whas it possible that uskashed had somehow survived? Darrus tapped “Yes” to view the message which read. “fix ship find st” followed by an automated note reading “:message was sent automatically due to 5 minutes of inactivity. ” This suggested that USkashed was in fact dead and was unable to finish the messagebefore he hit the surface of teh streats below. \r\n\r\nDarrus did not care much for Uskashed. He was only a friend to Darrus because he was not an enemy. Uskashed kept in touch to check on the status of his ship which he gave to Darrus. He was fond of Uskashed’s hreatfullness and generosity but never cared for the man himself. Finacially, everything was looking up for Darrus. He had the funds to repair his ship and hire a new crew. This was made better by the fact that Uskashed was dead. He would never hsve to repay his debt. His future was lighting up before his eyes. First he would repair his ship, then travel to a few systems and recruit dome ship hands. He would earn additional credits, of course, he would sell his services to anyone willing to pay. He and his crew would scavange the galaxy searching for jobs and gaining recognition on a galactic scale. \r\n\r\nThe racing thoughts passing through his head made the time pass by more quickly.\r\n\r\n“How’s it look?” Darrus snapped back to reality.\r\n\r\n“Huh?”\r\n\r\n“How does it look?” The senator was awake on the bed and was pointing at her leg. \r\n\r\n“Swollen.”\r\n\r\n“Could you take off the bandage?” Darrus stood and knelt beside the bed by her leg.\r\n\r\n“Can you lift it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Hand me a pillow.” She passed him a pillow and raised her leg. Darrus placed the pillow under her thigh. He unwrapped the bandage making circular movements over and under the injured calf. As skin began to show, Darrus noticed its swolleness and peculiar pulsing and purple color. \r\n\r\n“Its purple and beating like a heart.”\r\n\r\n“Good. I think the structure is repaired. Its being strengthened and the tissue is reattaching to the bone.” The senator said in relief.\r\n\r\n“Will you be able to walk soon?”\r\n\r\n“Likely. Within an hour or so.”\r\n\r\n“It’s amazing how fast your kind can heal.” He said as he stood and faced the door opposite the bed. “Its a shame that the Karian genome is rejected by the human chromosomes. I remember reading the histories. We has suspition that your kind was the key to our immortality.” Darrus looked out the small peephole in the thick metal door. “I never was one for genetic augmentaion. It never turns out good for anyone. I thought it humorous that it was you kinf that pished the hardest for altering genes and causing mutation given your rick past of morals from your ancient ancestors.” Darrus paused, took in a deep breath through his nose and released from his mouth loudly. “The human soul is cursed with instability. We are never satisfied with waht we have. When we see somethign better or someone with something better, we can’t help but want it. Its in our bones, we crave improvement but are too blind to go about getting it the right way.” A loud clank in the ship’s hull and a quick flicker of the interior lights. Darrus continued, “If we catch what we were chasing, its never enough we’ll just chase the next think till we catch it or it kills us.” Lights in the room flashed yellow three times. “The saddest part of our condition is we never know we have a problem but nobody never tries to do anything to fix it.”\r\n\r\nThe senator sensed the tense moment and waited for DArrus to walk back to his chair, remove his coat from the chair and put it on. She watched him sling the rearly covering over his sholder and worm his arms through the shiny sleaves. “We’ve entered atmosphere.” She said.\r\n\r\n“I know.” He began shelving his possesions back into his pockets and poped his collar. Moments passed in absolute scilence. Darrus took out his tablet and poked and slid his index finger across the screen. Darrus was starring at his credit balance, saying the number in his head. “Fifteen million forty-six thousand nine hundred and eighty two.” Repair costs about two-million. Freshly charged fuel cell seventy-five thousand. That leaved me about thirteen million to get a start on things. The senator sat up and tested the strength of her leg on the floor. \r\n\r\n“How is it?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll be fine to walk if I take it easy. Back to normal soon.” \r\n\r\nJust then the door slid into the wall in a snap and Darrus turned to look outside. He saw teh Falkmar standing with two men near teh bay doors. Her thin purple arm raised toward Darrus and motioned for them to come by curing her index finger. Darrus turned his head to the senator who by now had positioned herself to see out of the door. “Come on.” He said, “I think we’re getting off.” The senator stood.\r\n\r\n“Right you are.”, the Falkmar’s voice echoed through the bay. “Let’s go. You’ll hurry if you know what’s good for you.”, She said snarly. The senator walked to Darrus and the pair left the room and approached the Dalkmar. Upon their jouney the bay doors cracked and began to fold open. “Stand here please.” one of the men beside her demanded. He motioned at a red line just in front of the bay opening. “Dawn is approaching. You will need to find cover soon.” The Falkmar looked disdainfully at the senator. “It would be a shame id the Karian got toased berore her dear father could rescue her.” She chucked. By now, the doors had fully opened and cool air rushed in the bay whipping the loose flaps of Darrus’ jacket. The view outside was hazy, the light was pinkish-puple and the horizon was perfectly peabolic in shape. The ship was descending and more and more of the sandy ground beneath them was visible each passing second. Darrus and the senator stood just a few feet from the edge of the bay. Just a brisk step and they would have fallen out of the ship. The ship was now only a few feet from the surface. Darrus felt a pressure impending on his rear then found himself without ballance and falling out of the ship. He hit the sandy earth below with a thud and looked to his left where the senator lay as hi, on her face in the sand. The roar of the ship’s engines was deffening. Darrus turned while laying on his front and looked at the bay opening of the ship. The Falkmar bent over the ledge, blew the pair a kiss, smiled and waved her hand as the ship elevated and accelerated out of view.\r\n\r\nDarrus stood without trouble and assisted teh senator to her feet. “You ok?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my leg is fine. It still hurts but I’ll be fine.”\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere was hazy and it burned the throat to breathe.“We need to find shelter. Look for somethign sticking ut of the sand. The sun is hot as Hell. It’ll fry us if we stay outside. ” Darrus looked east. “We’ve got maybe ten minutes till she starts rising. Let’s go toward those dunes.” He pointedwest where a group of hills lay gleamingin the pink haze. The two began movinf to the dunes as quick as they were able. The loose sand slipped under their feet making it difficult to make any noticable speed. They reached the base of a small dune and climbed it, flinging scoops of sand and dust behind them. Once on top of the dune, Darrus looked over his sholder and was greeted by a glistening ruby cresent inching above the horizon. Even though the dense haze, it was already bright enough to burn his eyes. He looked all around, pale tired eyes squinting. His hand on his brow to shield the rising sun. Through the dust he saw a dark sylinderjutting from the sanda good distance away. He pointed , “There! Hurry the sun is risingfater now.” He led the way sliding down the sandy slope as the senator followed. At the bottom of the slope Darrus stumbled but was able to regain his posture withthe weight if his arms. The senator began to stumble likewise but he braced her and the two began treking through the sand.\r\n\r\nDArrus could feel the sand filling in his boots but it diddnt matter now. All that mattered was speed. THe cylinder they were chasing may be blocked off. Then what? He would have to find another one or be burned alive. There was no shade, no trees just sand and the dunes would do little to block the sun. IT was higher now Darrus felt the heat on his back. His eyes were fixed on the cylinder when he stumbled in the cumbersome sand. Only then did he loose sight for a second. \r\n\r\nThe sand in forn tof him grew redder and his shadow became more distinct from the lighted sand arround it. Darrus knew the sun was rising fat. He felt the heat on his neck increase by degree. He darred not look at it, his eyes on the cylinder. “What if this one’s blocked?”, He thought. The senator kept pase with Darrus, they were both panting heavailly and almost out of breath but the intense heat of the red sun pushed them on. Darrus began to see details about the sylinder. Engraved on the side going along the length of the tube were letters reading “ENTE” the rest was covered with sand. The last letter almost indecisive, it could wasially be a “B” if out of context. The cylinder was indeed a pipe protruding from the sand at an angle with a metal stair case leading to the opening. They had reached the pipe and turned to climb the stairs. DArrus felt the burning sun on the right side of his face. It singed his whiskers as he cranked open the vault door in front of  the large metal pipe. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', '2016-12-23 02:42:14', '2016-12-23 02:42:14')[0m
